BLOCK2 - ADD OFFSET 0x50000 for complete disassm!

Everything starts at 0x00
after some HW-init call to 0xde0

0xde0 calls 0x7bf4 and goes into an endless loop

0x7bf4 does some more init, creates some semaphores(??) and registers the main_task in the OS

the main_task at 75c0 registers some more tasks:
	0x6564=>TF_AV_Task (Audio-Video?)
	0xcbd8=>TF_Console_Task
	0xee54=>TF_HTTP_Task
	0x7330=>TF_TFVEP_Task (what's this for?)
