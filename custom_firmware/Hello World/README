This code is a "Hello World" for the TF-680 on the LKV373

provided and (c) 2020 by kitten_nb_five

everything except stubs.c is under AGPL v3 or later

THIS IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY! YOU MAY BRICK YOUR DEVICE! DO NOT TRY IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A WAY TO REPROGRAMM THE FLASH EXTERNALLY!

Instructions:
You will need an Arch Linux machine and recompile newlib and GCC for NDS32. See utils_arch for details.

Once everything is setup just execute ./compile *.c and flash the resulting file firmware.bin using the web-UI. The device will automatically reboot and you should see some output on the serial console (115200 8N1).

This firmware is a simple example and does not contain any web-UI or serial console. However you can get back into the bootloader (web-UI on 192.168.168.221) by pressing the reset-button on your device. You should get some output on the serial console confirming that it worked.

Warning: For going into the bootloader the code is erasing some part of the flash. I have no idea how many times you can do this before the FLASH will be broken. Use at your own risk (i already said this didn't i?).

Have fun. Feedback welcome.
