EDIT: THIS IS OLD AND INCOMPLETE. If you want to mess with it ask on freenode for new version or update the disassm yourself.


This is some code i wrote trying to implement NDS32-support inside radare2/Cutter.

This code is experimental, incomplete, probably full of bugs and provided AS IS. NO WARRANTY.

plugins.def.cfg comes from radare2 and was modified by me. It keeps it's original licence.

All the other stuff was written by me (kitten_nb_five) and is licenced under AGPL version 3 or later.

The documentation on how to implement stuff inside r2 is sadly limited, my work is mainly based on https://radareorg.github.io/blog/posts/extending-r2-with-new-plugins/.
